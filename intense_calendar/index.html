                <h2>About Agressive Calendar</h2>
                <p>Calendars have been used for a long time, dating back to about 3100 BC. Yet, from our perspective they haven’t changed much, and with the modern world constantly on the move, your calendaring needs should be too. Now introducing, the aggressive calendar. Do you ever ignore notifications, or procrastinate things until it is far too late to finish them? I know I have. And now, using the aggressive calendar this can be a thing of the past. You can either enter in a to do list and a general outline for your days, and it will automatically set plans for your day for you based off AI machine learning to your habits. Or you could schedule your own time down to the minute, and it will make sure you don’t forget a single item on your calendar. Having a calendar can be your first step to successfully planning out your day. However, just having a calendar isn’t enough for some people. Because like me, they will put something into their calendar and never look back at it again until the notification goes off that the event starts right that second. And so, we have this new calendar concept.</p>
