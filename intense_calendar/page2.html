                    It's a calendar, quite simply you can enter your events and times and then set a priority level for it, whether its an oh just make sure I get there on time to a this is due this day and if I don't do it, I will fail college. With these differing levels of priority, you will get differing levels of notifications and feedback. This calendar plays dirty. Do you procrastinate too much? The calendar can add a bit of random into your life, telling you that a very important assignment is due in just one hour! You rush to get it done, just to see, in one hours’ time a notification that says just kidding its due tomorrow, but since you’ve started working you better finish anyways. And then the more you ignore the calendar’s attempts at notifying you, the more notifications it will send. Quite a nasty little bugger isn't it.

                    But there’s only so much a calendar can do, it is wholly reliant on you putting your events into it, and that is why we say who needs a mother constantly nagging on your shoulder to get you to do something, when she can remotely add items to your to do list and we can get mad at you for not doing them for her. Or who needs to manage multiple calendars, when we sync with google, outlook, and I-calendar. Now are system is only as infallible as you let it be
