        Calendars have been used for a long time, dating back to about 3100 BC. Yet, from our perspective they haven’t changed much, and with the modern world constantly on the move, your calendaring needs should be too. Now introducing, the aggressive calendar. Do you ever ignore notifications, or procrastinate things until it is far too late to finish them? I know I have. And now, using the aggressive calendar this can be a thing of the past. You can either enter in a to do list and a general outline for your days, and it will automatically set plans for your day for you based off AI machine learning to your habits. Or you could schedule your own time down to the minute, and it will make sure you don’t forget a single item on your calendar. Having a calendar can be your first step to successfully planning out your day. However, just having a calendar isn’t enough for some people. Because like me, they will put something into their calendar and never look back at it again until the notification goes off that the event starts right that second. And so, we have this new calendar concept.

      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>
        It’s a calendar, quite simply you can enter your events and times and then set a priority level for it, whether its an oh just make sure I get there on time to a this is due this day and if I don’t do it, I will fail college. With these differing levels of priority, you will get differing levels of notifications and feedback. This calendar plays dirty. Do you procrastinate too much? The calendar can add a bit of random into your life, telling you that a very important assignment is due in just one hour! You rush to get it done, just to see, in one hours’ time a notification that says just kidding its due tomorrow, but since you’ve started working you better finish anyways. And then the more you ignore the calendar’s attempts at notifying you, the more notifications it will send. Quite a nasty little bugger isn’t it.

      </ul>
      <h3>don't forget to relax</h3>
      <p>
        Now, this methodology isn’t for everyone, and should not be used by the faint of heart. This aggressive calendar knows no bounds, follows no rules, and can even set alarms off on your device to remind you of the very important tasks you need to get done. Now, having a calendar like this can be stressful, and so we also recommend scheduling relax times into your schedule. Times you can just sit around and not have to worry about doing anything. Now if you put these scheduled relaxation times into your calendar, we can even aggressively remind you to take a break.
